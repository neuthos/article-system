Recent scientific advances have deepened our understanding of sleep architecture and the factors that influence restorative rest.</p><p>The sleep cycle consists of several distinct stages, each serving different physiological and neurological functions. Light sleep, deep sleep, and REM (rapid eye movement) sleep work together to support memory consolidation, cellular repair, immune function, and emotional processing. The proportion and timing of these stages change throughout the night and over the lifespan.</p><p>Circadian rhythms—our internal biological clocks—heavily influence sleep quality. These rhythms respond primarily to light exposure, which signals to the brain whether it should produce melatonin, the hormone that facilitates sleep. Modern lifestyles often disrupt these natural cycles through artificial lighting, irregular schedules, and screen use, contributing to sleep difficulties.</p><p>Sleep environment plays a crucial role in rest quality. Temperature, noise, light, and bedding comfort all affect how quickly people fall asleep and how often they experience nighttime awakenings. Research suggests that slightly cool rooms (around 65-68°F or 18-20°C) generally promote better sleep for most people.</p><p>Cognitive and behavioral factors significantly impact sleep.
